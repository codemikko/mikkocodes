Im currently reworking my website here that you are viewing and to be honest, its all coming along really well. There are a few kinks, but for the most part its about 80% functional and Im excited about it since this is my first [SvelteKit ](https://kit.svelte.dev/)Project.

[SvelteKit ](https://kit.svelte.dev/)is very interesting and always have wondered about it up until now I wanted something I can use with ease and get things rolling. So its coming! For now, check out my [Github](https://github.com/codemikko)
